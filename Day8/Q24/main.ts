// Question 24: More Conditional Tests: Expand your conditional tests to cover a wider range of comparisons.

let fruit: string[] = ["Mango", "Apple", "Kivi", "Banana"];

console.log("Is Kivi in fruit, I predict True");
console.log(fruit.includes("Kivi"));

console.log("Is Orange in fruit, I predict False");
console.log(!fruit.includes("Orange"));
